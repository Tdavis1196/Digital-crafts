        I have to go with Chef Curry at my point guard. His shooting ability is unmatched and has 
        revolutionized the game. For opposing guards in the league, Steph is an extremely tough cover
        and can fire anytime. He just got done with a season that was better, individually speaking,
        than the season when he won the NBA's Most Valuable Player by unaminous vote, first ever!
        He posted averages of 32.0 ppg, 5.5 rpg, and 5.8 apg this most recent season. He did that
        while shooting 48% from the field, 42% from the 3 while leading the league in 3pt attempts(12.7 per game).
