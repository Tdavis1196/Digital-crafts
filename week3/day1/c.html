            Shaquille "Shaq" O'Neal is the most dominant player in the history of the NBA.Shaq dominated the court both offensively and defensively.
            During his career, he scored 28,596 points. He also grabbed 13,099 rebounds, which places him 15th for the all-time record. Defensively,
            he also blocked 2,732 shots, placing him 8th all-time in that category as well. So not only could Shaq score, but he could also rebound
            and defend with the very best. This will be my final selection for my All-Time starting 5. No other team would be able to match the scoring
            and defense prowness of this team assembled right here within these pages.
