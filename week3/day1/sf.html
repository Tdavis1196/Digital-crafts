        At small forward, I am going with Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan has played all 82 games of the
        season nine times in his career. So you know the old adage, the best ability is availabiliity. 
        But to couple that to an already enormous list of God-given talent was the icing on the cake.
        Michael Jordan IS the best player in NBA history. 6-0 in the finals is squeaky clean, throw in
        10 scoring titles and 9 All-NBA Defensive teams, through the roof bunnies, and you have the GOAT!
        Between MJ and Kobe, the opposing wings will have a tough time on both ends.
