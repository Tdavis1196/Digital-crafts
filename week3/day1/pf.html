            At the 4, I am taking LeBron James. Not only has James accomplished great things,
            but he also plays at a higher level and a more well-rounded level than anyone in
            history. James can do it all. He can score on any given night, he can rebound the
            ball, and he is the greatest passing forward in league history. He currently is the
            only player in league history that sits in the top 10 for points scored and assists.
            He also sits in the top 50 all-time in rebounds. He's the only player ever to record
            over 34,000 points. 9,000 assists, and 9,000 rebounds.
