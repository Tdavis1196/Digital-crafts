            I am going with Kobe as my 2, however he is interchangeable with the person I have at the small forward position. He is one of
            the greatest scorers in NBA history. He is the owner of the second most impressive game in NBA history, when he dropped 81 points
            while shooting 61% from the field and above 50% from 3. Kobe Bryant spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers and
            accomplished so much. He played both sides of the ball well, earning 12 All-NBA Defensive Teams during his career. Among shooting
            guards all-time, he places first in points, first in rebounds, and second in assists, proving that he excelled as an all around player
            throughout his entire career. Depending on how you look at it, you can say he had 2 HOF Careers, one with No. 8 and another with No. 24,
            both identical in stature.
